## Test

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

#Loss = 0, Win = 1
payout <- c(0, 1)

#Probability for Loss = 15 %, probability for Win = 85 %
probability <- c(0.15, 0.85)

#Streak length of interest
streak <- 44

#Number of games played
games <- 50000

#How many times we iterate over the simulation
replicates <- 1000

#Simulate sample of 20000 games such that in each game, we win 85% of the time and lose 15% of the time
#Result: list of 0s and 1s for each game
sample(payout, games, replace=TRUE, prob = probability)

#For these games, calculate the length of each win streak. Result: list of winning streak lengths across all 20000 games
rle(sample(payout, games, replace=TRUE, prob = probability))$lengths

#Calculate the number of winning streaks longer than 44
sum(rle(sample(payout, games, replace=TRUE, prob = probability))$lengths > streak)

#Do all of the above simultaneously 1000 times
replicate(replicates, sum(rle(sample(payout, games, replace=TRUE, prob = probability))$lengths > streak))

#Calculate the number of times there were 0 winning streaks of at least 44 games, express it as a probability
sum(replicate(replicates, sum(rle(sample(payout, games, replace=TRUE, prob = probability))$lengths > streak)) == 0) / replicates

#Histogram of MAX winstreak lengths
hist(replicate(replicates, max(rle(sample(payout, games, replace=TRUE, prob = probability))$lengths)))


#Prettier histogram
chess_data <- tibble(x = replicate(replicates, max(rle(sample(payout, games, replace=TRUE, prob = probability))$lengths)))
