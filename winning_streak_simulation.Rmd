Below is a simple simulation for winning streak lengths when the outcome is either a "win" with 85% probability or a "loss" with 15% probability. 

I'm using a streak length of 44 as a "length of interest". If 50 000 games are played given these probabilities, then the likelihood of <b>not</b> having a winning streak of at least 44 games at least once, is 0.6% (0.006). 

Over 50 000 games given the above probabilities for wins and losses, one should on average expect to have 4.967 winning streaks (SD = 2.18517) that are at least 44 games long. Finally, I visualize the distribution of the longest winning streaks for each 1000 simulated set of 50 thousand games. As can be seen in the figure (histogram), even winning streaks of 80+ games are certainly not unheard of, given these parameters.

## Simulations
```{r, message=FALSE, include=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

#Loss = 0, Win = 1
result <- c(0, 1)

#Probability for Loss = 15 %, probability for Win = 85 % (roughly approximating an elo-rating difference of 300)
probability <- c(0.15, 0.85)

#Streak length of interest
streak <- 44

#Number of games played
games <- 50000

#How many times we iterate over the simulation
replicates <- 1000

#Simulate sample of 50000 games such that in each game, we win 85% of the time and lose 15% of the time
#Result: list of 0s and 1s for each game (display first 30)
set.seed(1)
head(sample(result, games, replace=TRUE, prob = probability), 30)

#For these games, calculate the length of each win streak. 
#Result: list of winning streak lengths across all 50000 games (display first 30)
set.seed(1)
head(rle(sample(result, games, replace=TRUE, prob = probability))$lengths, 30)

#Calculate the number of winning streaks longer than 44
set.seed(1)
sum(rle(sample(result, games, replace=TRUE, prob = probability))$lengths > streak)

#Calculate the number of winning streaks longer than 44 1000 times, obtain mean and standard deviation
set.seed(1)
head(replicate(replicates, sum(rle(sample(result, games, replace=TRUE, prob = probability))$lengths > streak)), 30)
mean(replicate(replicates, sum(rle(sample(result, games, replace=TRUE, prob = probability))$lengths > streak)))
sd(replicate(replicates, sum(rle(sample(result, games, replace=TRUE, prob = probability))$lengths > streak)))


#Calculate the number of times there were 0 winning streaks of at least 44 games, express it as a probability
set.seed(1)
sum(replicate(replicates, sum(rle(sample(result, games, replace=TRUE, prob = probability))$lengths > streak)) == 0) / replicates
```

## Histogram
```{r, message=FALSE, include=TRUE}
#Histogram showing the distribution of the maximum streak lengths across all simulations
set.seed(1)
chess_data <- tibble(x = replicate(replicates, max(rle(sample(result, games, replace=TRUE, prob = probability))$lengths)))

chess_data %>% ggplot(aes(x)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), color = "black", fill = "lightblue") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent(accuracy = 1L)) +
  labs(y = "Proportion", x = "Maximum winning streak length (number of games)",
       title = "20k games played (simulated 1000 times), 300 elo difference") +
  theme_bw()
```
