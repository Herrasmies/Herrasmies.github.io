This video poker simulator seeks to illustrate the spread (variance) of wins and losses between multiple hypothetical players and different levels of game volatility. The simulator may be helpful for players who are unfamiliar with the logic of gambling, and who may be at risk of becoming problem gamblers. In the simulations...

* The bet size is 1 euro each round
* 5 rounds are played per minute
* The spread of wins and their probabilities (under optimal strategy) in the low / medium / high volatility version of the game are
  + Royal flush: 2000e / 500e / 100e (0.002%)
  + Straight flush: 50e / 55e / 50e (0.011%)
  + Four of a kind: 33e / 45e / 30e (0.236%)
  + Full house: 14e / 13e / 15e (1.151%)
  + Flush: 7e / 7e / 8e (1.101%)
  + Straight: 5e / 6e / 7e (1.123%)
  + Three of a kind: 3e / 3e / 3e (7.445%)
  + Two pair: 2e / 2e / 2e (12.928%)
* The return to player (RTP) rates on optimal strategy are 89.955% (low volatility), 89.934% (medium volatility), and 89.965% (high volatility) 
* Optimal playing strategy is used
* The "luckiest" and "unluckiest" players are visualized based on their results at the end of each simulation

These wins and their probabilities are based on information provided in https://www.pinnacle.com/en/betting-articles/casino/video-poker-odds-and-strategy/8RP2WGBBQFJ498LD , but may significantly differ from other video poker games (and other similar games) elsewhere

## Low volatility (10 hours)
### Animation

If you and 99 of your friends all played the low volatility video poker game for 10 hours, the luckiest and unluckiest one of you might have the following results:
```{r}
set.seed(1)
animation <- casino_simulator(3000, 100, T, "low") + 
  geom_segment(aes(xend = 3000, yend = value), linetype = 2, colour = 'grey') + 
  geom_point(size=2) +
  geom_text(aes(x = 3000, label = key, color=profit), hjust = 0) +
  geom_text(aes(x = ID, label = round(value, -1), color = profit), vjust=2) +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("red", "darkgreen", "salmon", "lightblue")) +
  transition_reveal(ID) +
  coord_cartesian(clip = 'off') +
  theme(plot.margin = margin(5.5, 50, 5.5, 5.5))

animate(animation, duration = 15, fps = 10)
```

### All players

```{r}
set.seed(1)
casino_simulator(3000, 100, F, "low")
```

## Medium volatility (10 hours)
### Animation

If you and 99 of your friends all played the medium volatility video poker game for 10 hours, the luckiest and unluckiest one of you might have the following results:
```{r}
set.seed(1)
animation <- casino_simulator(3000, 100, T, "med") + 
  geom_segment(aes(xend = 3000, yend = value), linetype = 2, colour = 'grey') + 
  geom_point(size=2) +
  geom_text(aes(x = 3000, label = key, color=profit), hjust = 0) +

  coord_cartesian(clip = 'off') +
  theme(plot.margin = margin(5.5, 50, 5.5, 5.5))

animate(animation, duration = 15, fps = 10)
```

### All players

```{r}
set.seed(1)
casino_simulator(3000, 100, F, "med")
```

## Medium volatility (30 hours)
### Animation

If you and 99 of your friends all played the medium volatility video poker game for 30 hours, the luckiest and unluckiest one of you would have the following results:
```{r}
set.seed(1)
animation <- casino_simulator(9000, 100, T, "med") + 
  geom_segment(aes(xend = 9000, yend = value), linetype = 2, colour = 'grey') + 
  geom_point(size=2) +
  geom_text(aes(x = 9000, label = key, color=profit), hjust = 0) +
  geom_text(aes(x = ID, label = round(value, -1), color = profit), vjust=2) +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("red", "darkgreen", "salmon", "lightblue")) +
  transition_reveal(ID) +
  coord_cartesian(clip = 'off') +
  theme(plot.margin = margin(5.5, 50, 5.5, 5.5))

animate(animation, duration = 25, fps = 10)
```

### All players

```{r}
set.seed(1)
casino_simulator(9000, 100, F, "med")
```

## High volatility (30 hours)

When the "main prize" is very large, there are proportionally, and perhaps even deceptively, more players in profit ("lucky winners"). 
```{r}
set.seed(1)
casino_simulator(9000, 100, F, "high")
```

## Proportion of winners across volatility levels

Below I've calculated the mean- and standard deviation values for proportion of winning players after a specific number of rounds played for all three levels of volatility. This is done by rerunning the simulations multiple times (500, 100, 75 or 50 times depending on the number of rounds being simulated and computing time requirements -- note that this part of the code was run externally).

The mean proportion of players who are winning after 1, 10, 30, 50, 75 or 100 hours of play depends heavily on the game‚Äôs volatility level. Figure 1 shows that the proportion of players in profit (‚Äúlucky winners‚Äù) significantly depends on volatility. In the high volatility version of the game, 16.37 % are winning after 30 hours of play, and 5.16 % are winning even after 100 hours of continued play. Error bars represent 95 % confidence intervals. 

```{r}
#Values below obtained from externally run simulations!
winners <- tibble(mean = c(23.52, 2.03, 0.02, 0, 0, 0,
                           23.74, 7.11, 1.46, 0.307, 0.06, 0,

                lower = mean - qt(.975, n())*se,

                volatility = factor(volatility, levels=c("Low\nvolatility", "Medium\nvolatility", "High\nvolatility")))

winners %>% ggplot(aes(length, mean, color = volatility)) +
